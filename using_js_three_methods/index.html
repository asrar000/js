    <!--
      This is the best and most modern way of using external JavaScript. 
      Here, defer is enabled by default, so there is no need to explicitly
      use the keyword. This approach is recommended. One thing to note is 
      that it will give you a CORS error if you try to access it without 
      setting up a server.

    <!--
      <script defer src="script.js"></script>
    -->
    <!--
      This method is slightly more modern than the old one and is 
      somewhat better in the sense that it defers execution until the 
      HTML loads properly. As a result, DOM access is safer than with 
      the previous approach. However, it is still not the best way.

    <!--
      This is an old way of doing things. It must be placed before the 
      </body> tag to allow the HTML to load and parse first. However, it is 
      not recommended and is the worst of the three ways of including 
      scripts in this context.
