    <!-- 
      Recommended modern approach.
      Module scripts automatically behave like "defer":
      - Download in parallel.
      - Do not block HTML parsing.
      - Execute after HTML is fully parsed.
      - Run in strict mode.
      - Have module scope (no global pollution).

      If ES module imports are used, the file should be served
      through a local or remote server. Opening via file:// may
      cause CORS-related errors.
    -->
    <script type="module" src="script.js"></script>

    <!-- 
      Alternative modern approach.
      The "defer" attribute ensures:
      - Script downloads in parallel.
      - Execution happens after HTML parsing completes.
      - Execution order is preserved.
    -->
    <!-- <script defer src="script.js"></script> -->

    <!-- 
      Traditional blocking script in <head>.
      - Stops HTML parsing.
      - Downloads and executes immediately.
      - Not recommended for performance.
    -->
    <!-- <script src="script.js"></script> -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <button>Click me</button>

    <!-- 
      If a normal script (without defer or module) is placed 
      at the start of <body>, like this:

      <body>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
        <button>Click me</button>

      The browser:
      1. Stops parsing HTML.
      2. Downloads and runs the script.
      3. The button is not yet in the DOM.

      Therefore, document.querySelector("button") would return null.
    -->

    <!-- 
      Older safe practice:
      Place a normal script just before </body>.
      This ensures the entire DOM is parsed before execution.
    -->
    <!-- 
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    -->

    <!-- 
      "defer" and "type=module" scripts can technically be placed
      inside <body>, but it is unnecessary because they already wait
      for HTML parsing to complete. They are typically placed in <head>.
    -->
  </body>
