            /*Explanation*******************************
            In JavaScript, you can reassign a variable object as a whole, but you cannot reassign a const object as a 
            whole. However, for both let/var and const objects, you can update properties, delete properties, and add 
            new properties. In a sense, you can completely change the contents of a const object by modifying or 
            deleting all of its properties. Only when an object is frozen using Object.freeze() are property additions, 
            deletions updates prevented.

    

            In JavaScript:
            (i)A function is just a value
            (ii)A method is simply a function stored as an object property
            So this:
            person1.getFullName = getFullName;

            means:

            “Store a reference to the function getFullName inside person1 under the key getFullName”
            Once stored, calling it like this:
            person1.getFullName();
            makes it a method call.

            #####Some crucial things to keep in mind is that

            obj.propertyname=functionname;
            So the function call so be made by obj.propertyname() not using obj.functionname() it is wrong and another
            crucial thing is you cannot attach method to an object after object creation but in JS you can do this

            Finally lets talk  about the frozen objects,Now the idea of the frozen object is only the 
            defined property and methods can be accessed but no update/add/delete of property can be done and as the
            method to froze an object is shallow so to froze all the nested objects within a frozen object we have 
            to froze them individually

            The JS + thing,
            When unary + is applied to a number it does nothing have no change but not wrong but when applied to non 
            numbers something like string it can change it to number type just like Number() but shorter and something 
            like "2"+"3" = "23" but something like +"2" + +"3"=5 as the + unary acts like Number()  again something
            like +"2" + "3"="23" as it converts the string to number however as "3" is string so string concatenation
            happens
            And in case of non string numbers something like

            +""=0
            +"dasdasd"=NaN[Discussed Below]
            +true=1
            +false=0

            ********************
            The weird Comma operator in JS
            
            The comma operator , is one of the rarest and most unusual operators. Sometimes, it’s used to write 
            shorter code, so we need to know it in order to understand what’s going on.
            The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma ,. Each of them 
            is evaluated but only the result of the last one is returned.

            For example:
            let a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);
            alert( a ); // 7 (the result of 3 + 4)
            Here, the first expression 1 + 2 is evaluated and its result is thrown away. Then, 3 + 4 is 
            evaluated and returned as the result.
            
            Comma has a very low precedence
            Please note that the comma operator has very low precedence, lower than =, so parentheses are important in 
            the example above.Without them: a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4 evaluates + first, summing the numbers into a = 3, 7, then
            the assignment operator = assigns a = 3, and the rest is ignored. It’s like (a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4.

            Why do we need an operator that throws away everything except the last expression?
            Sometimes, people use it in more complex constructs to put several actions in one line.


            For example:


            // three operations in one line

            for (let a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b; c < 10; c++) {
            ...
            }
            Here,The a,b variables are used for the calculation of c mainly.[One of the uses of comma operator is doing
            intermediary calulations]

            Such tricks are used in many JavaScript frameworks. That’s why we’re mentioning them. But usually they 
            don’t improve code readability so we should think well before using them.
           
            ############################
            THE GOLDEN RULES
            "" + 1 + 0 = "10" // (1)
            "" - 1 + 0 = -1 // (2)
            true + false = 1
            6 / "3" = 2
            "2" * "3" = 6
            4 + 5 + "px" = "9px"
            "$" + 4 + 5 = "$45"
            "4" - 2 = 2
            "4px" - 2 = NaN
            "  -9  " + 5 = "  -9  5" // (3)
            "  -9  " - 5 = -14 // (4)
            null + 1 = 1 // (5)
            undefined + 1 = NaN // (6)
            " \t \n" - 2 = -2 // (7)
            (1)The addition with a string "" + 1 converts 1 to a string: "" + 1 = "1", and then we have "1" + 0, the same 
            rule is applied.
            (2)The subtraction - (like most math operations) only works with numbers, it converts an empty string "" to 0.
            (3)The addition with a string appends the number 5 to the string.
            (4)The subtraction always converts to numbers, so it makes " -9 " a number -9 (ignoring spaces around it).
            (5)null becomes 0 after the numeric conversion.
            (6)undefined becomes NaN after the numeric conversion.
            (7)Space characters are trimmed off string start and end when a string is converted to a number. 
            Here the whole string consists of space characters, such as \t, \n and a “regular” space between them. 
            So, similarly to an empty string, it becomes 0
