### Why choose swtich statement over conditonal(if,else if and else ) statements

if...else statements do the job of enabling conditional code well, but they are not without their downsides. They are mainly good for cases where you've got a couple of choices, and each one requires a reasonable amount of code to be run, and/or the conditions are complex (for example, multiple logical operators). For cases where you just want to set a variable to a certain choice of value or print out a particular statement depending on a condition, the syntax can be a bit cumbersome, especially if you've got a large number of choices.

In such a case, switch statements are your friend — they take a single expression/value as an input, and then look through several choices until they find one that matches that value, executing the corresponding code that goes along with it.
